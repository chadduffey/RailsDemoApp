A demonstration marketplace application using rails.

It currently accepts credit cards, however the back end is in test mode. The credit cards are processed using stripe.com.

I have commented out the bank account section. It should take bank accounts from sellers as part of the new user setup. However, i found some issues with international accounts and want to fix this first.
